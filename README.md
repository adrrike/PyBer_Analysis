# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. 
Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. 
Then, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 
Finally, submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type.


## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

*Insert Ride Analysis Chart

Fares in rural areas are on average $10 more than in urban areas. You could assume these trips are longer in length because of the distance between destinations in rural areas.
68% of PyBer's total rides are in urban areas. 26% of rides in suburban areas. Total of ~94% of rides are in urban and suburban areas. 
Only 2.6% of total drivers are in rural areas

*Insert line chart

Ridership fares peak slightly(specifically in rural areas) during weeks that contain either a 3 day weekend or an event weekend. New Year's Day, MLK Day, Super Bowl Sunday, President's Day, St. Patrick's Day. 


## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
Continue to market in urban areas as that is were the majority of ridership is. 
Continue to study rural area trips and make a decision whether to pursue this market more aggresively or divest from rural market all together. 
The low numbers could be because not as many people use PyBer in rural areas(more parking) or because of lack of drivers(only  2.6% of all PyBer drivers are in rural areas).

There is a market for higher fare longer trips in rural areas. 

I would recommend a deeper analysis into ridership during holiday/event weekends to see if it correlates throughout the year or across seperate years. This could be a significant weekend for marketing and profitability in PyBer's future.
