# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. 
Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. 
Then, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 
Finally, submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type.


## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

- Fares in rural areas are on average $10 more than in urban areas. You could assume these trips are longer in length because of the distance between destinations in rural areas.
- 68% of PyBer's total rides are in urban areas, 26% of rides in suburban areas
- ~94% of total rides are in either urban and suburban areas 
- Only 2.6% of total drivers are in rural areas

- Ridership fares peak slightly(specifically in rural areas) during weeks that contain either a 3 day weekend or an event weekend 
  - Weekends Include: New Year's Day, MLK Day, Super Bowl Sunday, President's Day, St. Patrick's Day


## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
- Continue to market in suburban and urban areas to gain/maintain strong ridership numbers 
- Continue to study/analyize rural area trips and make a decision whether to pursue this market more aggresively or divest from rural market all together 
  - The low numbers could be because not as many people use PyBer in rural areas(more parking) or because of lack of drivers(only 2.6% of all PyBer drivers are in rural areas).
- I would recommend a deeper analysis into ridership during holiday/event weekends to see if it continues to correlate to holiday/event weekends. This could be a significant   opportunities for marketing and profitability in PyBer's future.
